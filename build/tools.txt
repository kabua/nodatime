Notes on build tool plans...



SetVersion - need some equivalent, maybe.
(Or shell script with sed...)

docfx research:
- Producing a UID from a member. Find the code.
- Can we add extra yaml properties?
- Try a custom template

DocumentAnnotations:
Input: assembly + yml
Output: yml extras

DocumentVersions - no change needed?
(Just dotnet and package as a tool)
Input: assembly and xml
Output: rewritten xml

TweakSandcastleStyle: kill
