Noda Time is an alternative date and time API for .NET. It helps you to
think about your data more clearly, and express operations on that data more
precisely.

* [Project web site](http://nodatime.org) - for documentation, installation, downloads etc
* [Group/mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/noda-time) - for discussion of potential features 
* [Project source and issue site](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime)
* [Stack Overflow tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nodatime) - for specific "How do I do X?" questions

The above links should be used for most interactions. The Gitter chat linked below is also available,
but as Noda Time is a small project, there are rarely people actively watching the chat - most concerns
are better handled on Stack Overflow, the mailing list, or as a GitHub issue.
